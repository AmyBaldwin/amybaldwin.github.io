[Core](https://amybaldwin.github.io/Core/): A comprehensive whole genome analysis pipeline for microbial isolates. 

[Tool 1](https://amybaldwin.github.io/Tool_1/): A mass screening tool using up-to-date, curated databases 

[Tool 2](https://amybaldwin.github.io/Tool_2/): A genome mass screening tool with bespoke sequences 

[Tool 3](https://amybaldwin.github.io/Tool_3/): A whole genome comparison tool 

[Tool 4](https://amybaldwin.github.io/Tool_4/): Finding unique sections of DNA for primer design


Alternatively, my [RunAnyTool](https://amybaldwin.github.io/RunAnyTool/) guide describes the quick and easy set up almost any software tool on your system. To use space efficiently, the tools can easily be removed once analysis is complete. Set up does not require installing additional dependencies and can be completed in a matter of minutes.
